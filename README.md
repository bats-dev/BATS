<h2>Package description</h2> 

BATS - Bayesian Adaptive Trials Simulator - provides a flexible structure for
the fast simulation of Bayesian adaptive designs for clinical trials. This package can be used
to define and evaluate the operating characteristics of Bayesian adaptive designs for
various different types of primary outcomes (e.g., those that follow a
normal, binary, Poisson or negative binomial distribution) and can
incorporate the most common types of adaptations: stopping treatments
(or the entire trial) for efficacy or futility, and Bayesian response
adaptive randomisation - based on user-defined adaptation rules. Other
important features of this highly modular package include: parallel
processing, customisability, use on a cluster computer or PC/Mac, and
adjustment for covariates.
